## Architecture Freeze Review

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Would we rename any package today? | **No** |

## Token Living Period

Observations recorded in `docs/sprints/sprint-01-design-language.md`:

- Semantic layer complete for current components
- Component tokens justified (button, input, card)
- Theme contracts correct for light/dark
- Naming system scales — no changes required before foundation commit

**Token living period:** PASS

---

## Release Blockers Resolved

1. `@jedi/docs` token re-exports removed
2. Platform-wide public API audit completed
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LIFECYCLE.md`, `ADR-000` created
4. Architecture Decision Rule added to `CONSTITUTION.md`
5. Boundary checker enforces allowed dependency graph

---

## Acceptance Verdict

**PASS** — Foundation Program merged to `main` via PR #1.
